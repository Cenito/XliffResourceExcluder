# XliffResourceExcluder

Ever trying to integrate the Multilingual App Toolkit into existing projects, like ASP.NET with Entity Framework and Code First migrations, or Windows Forms with lots of resource (resx) files?
If so, you have probably noticed that the generated XLIFF files for translations gets bloated with unwanted resources that you never want to translate.

With Xliff Resource Excluder you can not batch select XLIFF files to process and resources (resx, resw) files, or even non-string types altogether, to exclude from ever being translated.
